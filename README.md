# Polynomial-Regression
Displaying car's emission as a second degree polynomial of its engine size.
# Code and resources
Python version: 3.9.9
Packages: pandas, numpy, sklearn, scipy, matplotlib
# Model Building
I have used a degree 2 polynomial to create a model.
I trained the model using 80% of the data and tested the model using the remaining 20%.
# Model Accuracy
R2 score = 0.75 (varies with iterations!)
